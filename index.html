            Overall Objective
          </p>

          <p>This example visualizes the Fire Department Calls for Service dataset from DataSF(<a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/" target="_blank">https://datasf.org/opendata/</a>). 
            The goal of the visualization is to analyze the location of existing stations and to figure out if the stations are properly positioned within the San Francisco and at the same time
            to also figure out if there is a need to add new stations or remove existing stations in order to ensure better public safety.</p>

          <h2 id="data">Data</h2>

          <p>Fire Calls-For-Service includes all fire units responses to calls. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, and disposition. All relevant time intervals are also included. Because this dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involved multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. Addresses are associated with a block number, intersection or call box, not a specific address.</p>
          <p>The original dataset includes over 5.21M rows as of 16 February 2020. The original dataset includes 34 columns and each row is a response. The direct link to data set is: <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3/data" target="_blank">https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3/data</a> .

        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>

        <p>Perhaps you had to do some data wrangling to the original dataset to prepare it for visualization. This would be a great place to discuss some of that wrangling.

        <pre>
You can even put code into these pre blocks.
  It will preserve whitespace.
    That is helpful for formatted code.
        </pre>

        <p>You can alternatively embed a Gist if you want. There is an "embed" button on <a href="https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae">the Gist page</a> and results in something like this:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae.js"></script>

        <h2 id="visualizations">Visualizations</h2>

        <p>Ideally not everything would be on a single page like this example. Instead, you might want to put each section in its own webpage. You would need to carefully replicate the page template (with the header, navbar, and footer) and make the necessary updates. For example, you want the "About" navbar item to be considered active on an "About" web page.</p>

        <p>For now this is just a demo. The buttons below do not go anywhere, but can be easily changed to link to different visualization pages.</p>

        <p class="buttons">
          <a class="button is-large is-success" href="#">
            <span class="icon is-medium">
              <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i>
            </span>
            <span>Line Chart</span>
          </a>

          <a class="button is-large is-primary" href="#">
            <span class="icon is-medium">
              <i class="fas fa-chart-area"></i>
            </span>
            <span>Area Chart</span>
          </a>

          <a class="button is-large is-info" href="#">
            <span class="icon is-medium">
              <i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i>
            </span>
            <span>Bar Chart</span>
          </a>

          <a class="button is-large is-link" href="#">
            <span class="icon is-medium">
              <i class="fas fa-chart-pie"></i>
            </span>
            <span>Pie Chart</span>
          </a>
        </p>

        <!-- https://github.com/vega/vega-embed#basic-example -->
        <p>It is possible to embed some visualizations directly here too. Here is <a href="https://github.com/vega/vega-embed#basic-example">an example</a> using Vega-Lite:</p>

        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5.9.0"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@4.0.2"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.2.1"></script>

        <div id="vis"></div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
        var spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/examples/bar-chart.vg.json";
        vegaEmbed('#vis', spec).then(function(result) {
          // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
        }).catch(console.error);
        </script>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>

        <p>You will likely need to include instructions on how to interpet and use the visualization. In the case above, if you click the three dots <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h has-text-grey-light	"></i> above it will open a menu where you can either save the visualization to a SVG or PNG, or alternatively open it up in the online Vega Editor.</p>

        <h4>Discussion</h4>

        <p>You may also need other sections, like a discussion section, per-visualization section on data wrangling, and others. Because of the extra content and code visualizations take, it might be worthwhile to break up your pages into one home page and then one page per visualization.</p>
